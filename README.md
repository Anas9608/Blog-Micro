# üìù Blog Application Backend

This is a **Dockerized Node.js backend** for a blog application. It uses **MongoDB** for data persistence, **Redis** for session storage, and **Nginx** for load balancing. The app is structured using **Express.js** and **Mongoose** as the ORM for MongoDB.

## üê≥ Dockerized Services

The application is fully containerized using Docker. Here's a breakdown of the services:

- **App Service**: Runs the Node.js application.
- **MongoDB**: Stores blog posts and user data.
- **Redis**: Manages session data.
- **Nginx**: Acts as a reverse proxy/load balancer for the Node.js app.
